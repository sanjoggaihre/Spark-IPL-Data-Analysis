In this project, I learned how to use Apache Spark and Databricks for working with data. First, I loaded the data from an S3 bucket. Then, I cleaned the data by adding and removing some columns. After that, I converted the Spark DataFrame into SQL tables. I ran SQL queries on these tables to get useful information. This project helped me to understand how Spark and Databricks can be used for data processing and analysis.
